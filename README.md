# audioBox

There are students with certain disabilities which hinder the development of written activities, such as those that are disabled, having a broken arm, progressive loss of vision ... This project proposes the possibility of carrying out activities in audio format which is a format with many possibilities and some advantages with respect to video format. The documents generated must have a structure that allows browsing through the different sections (like the daisy books) to gain access to a particular activity, and not be forced to listen to it without interruptions.

### Requirements

The minimum requirements for running audioBox are:

 * Ruby 1.9.3
 * Rails 3.2 or bigger
 * A database (e.g. MySQL or SQLite)


### Installation

Follow the following steps:

 1. Extract audioBox.zip and cd to the newly created folder
 2. Update your bundle: $ bundle
 3. Create a database and schema: $ rake db:migrate
 4. Start the webserver: $ rails server
 5. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
 6. Enjoy!
