# audioBox

There are students with certain disabilities which hinder the development of written activities, such as those that are disabled, having a broken arm, progressive loss of vision ... This project proposes the possibility of carrying out activities in audio format which is a format with many possibilities and some advantages with respect to video format. The documents generated must have a structure that allows browsing through the different sections (like the daisy books) to gain access to a particular activity, and not be forced to listen to it without interruptions.

## Installation
